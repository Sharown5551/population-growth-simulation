# Population Growth Simulation

This MATLAB project compares two models of population growth:

- **Exponential Growth**: Assumes unlimited resources
- **Logistic Growth**: Includes a carrying capacity

## Features

- Simulates population growth over time
- Plots both exponential and logistic models
- Clear visualization with labeled axes and legend

## Parameters Used

- Initial population: 1000
- Growth rate: 3%
- Carrying capacity: 5000
- Time span: 0 to 50 years

## How to Run

Open `population_growth_clean.m` in MATLAB and run the script.  
It will generate a plot comparing the two growth models.

## Output

A figure titled *Exponential vs Logistic Growth*, showing:
- Blue dashed line: Exponential growth
- Red dashed line: Logistic growth
